# Sossoldi (Wealth management app)

"Sossoldi" is a wealth management / personal finance / Net Worth tracking app, made with Flutter.

#### What problem we are solving & why

[Mr. Rip](https://retireinprogress.com/) is a blogger that has a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ilL6rBdzIQ6yRotqOKLUKI7KXFxu5_cZ5FQgdYTSHJk/edit#gid=138629885) in which he tracks his net worth. Sossoldi is a Mobile + Desktop app that aims at replacing that spreadsheet and hopefully it will be easier to use for people that do not already have that kind of knowledge about personal finance.

The app will be developed using the [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) framework which makes it possible to have one codebase for different platforms (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux).

#### What’s already on the market?

Currently there are a lot of options on the market ([interface study](https://www.notion.so/Sossoldi-Personal-finance-app-dd37eb9cbb2c44e59dd74f85e843e865)) if you want to track your expenses, but most of them have limitations on what you can do without paying and it’s really difficult to track your investments or track your portfolio in different currencies.

#### High level approach

Who are we building for?
-   People that want to track their net worth
-   People that want to track expenses to better understand where they are spending their money
-   People that want to keep track of their investments
-   Mr. Rip followers

What features do we want to implement?
-   Track expenses (even recurrent ones)
-   Track different bank accounts
-   Graphs, statistics and reports
-   All data are stored locally (with the option to share it in different platforms)
-   Track investments: Stocks, Bonds, Crypto, Private equity
-   Track taxes
-   Net worth on different currencies
-   Import/export data
-   Link bank accounts that support the OpenBanking PSD2 API
-   Advanced onboarding

#### Phase 1
We will not build everything at once so we will start from the basic features and then we will move to the others.
Phase 1 will be completed when the following features will ready:
-   Expenses (even recurrent ones) tracker
-   Income tracker
-   Bank accounts balance (without the use of API)
-   Basic stats
-   Data stored only locally

The pages that will be implemented are:
-   Dashboard
-   Movements page
-   Basic settings
-   Basic onboarding
