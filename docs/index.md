## ❓ What problem we are solving & why

[Mr. Rip](https://retireinprogress.com/) is a blogger that has a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ilL6rBdzIQ6yRotqOKLUKI7KXFxu5_cZ5FQgdYTSHJk/edit#gid=138629885) in which he tracks his net worth. Sossoldi is a Mobile + Desktop app that aims at replacing that spreadsheet and make it easier for everyone to track their net worth even if they are not as skilled with Google sheets or Excel.

The app is being developed using the [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) framework which makes it possible to have one codebase for different platforms (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux). We are currently working on a beta which hopefully will be out soon.

## This app is for you if you want to...

- 📈 Track their net worth
- 💸 Track your expenses to better understand where they are spending their money
- 👀 Keep track of your investments
- 🪦 Keep everything in one place like Mr. Rip

What features do we want to implement?
